                    The news you have seen in the home page are fake, and these kind of fake news are everywhere. In the past five years, the internet has spread all over the world,
                    and the speed of information transmitted through the internet is
                    unimaginable. At the same time that the development of the
                    Internet has become faster, journalism is also expanding its own
                    development. In the past, the news only appears on TV or in
                    newspapers, and nowadays when we turn on our phones, we
                    can see countless kinds of news. These features have brought
                    convenience to our lives and also changed people's perception.
                    Faced with the development trend of the news industry, fake
                    news has begun to emerge quietly in the news media, making
                    true news begin to be affected and questioned. Authenticity
                    is the life of news, and any report that violates the facts or is
                    inconsistent with the facts can be called fake news. On social
                    media, everyone is free to express their opinions, and some
                    people can pretend to be fake news accounts to publish fake
                    news. And before this news is not proven to be fake news, people
                    will express their opinions. Whether positive or negative.
                </p>
                <br />  <br />
                <p>
                    Fake news causes citizens to lose trust in social media. The
                    rapid development of the self-media community has not only
                    increased the influence of fake news but also accelerated the
                    spread of fake news. Although I don't know their true purpose,
                    this wrong information seriously affected the authority and
                    credibility of the news media; led to the appearance of wrong
                    public opinion; violated the rights of citizens; wasted time and
                    money, and caused a huge impact on society, It can also cause
                    serious misunderstandings and contradictions between countries.
