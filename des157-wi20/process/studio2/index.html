            <h2>Laptop</h2><br>
            <p>Laptop is very important for study or work. Most of my class need us to use laptop on class, because we need to do notes and researches on class. I chose to carry it everyday even I have no class require to use it, the reason is that if I want to study in library besides study at home, I can use my computer anytime at anywhere, I think that's efficency and vey helpful for me.</p>

            <h2>Notebook</h2><br>
            <p>Sometimes take notes on laptop is not good as take notes on notebook. For some courses, take notes by writing by hands can help me memorize more concepts. Additionaly, always take a note book with me can solve some problems, for example, if the professor have a pop quiz for us, or if I need to take notes immediately when my laptop died.</p>
