           <p>In the past five years, the internet has spread all over the world, and the speed of information transmitted through the internet is unimaginable. At the same time that the development of the Internet has become faster, journalism is also expanding its own development. In the past, the news only appears on TV or in newspapers, and nowadays when we turn on our phones, we can see countless kinds of news. These features have brought convenience to our lives and also changed people's perception. Faced with the development trend of the news industry, fake news has begun to emerge quietly in the news media, making true news begin to be affected and questioned. Authenticity is the life of news, and any report that violates the facts or is inconsistent with the facts can be called fake news. On social media, everyone is free to express their opinions, and some people can pretend to be fake news accounts to publish fake news. And before this news is not proven to be fake news, people will express their opinions. Whether positive or negative. </p>
                
            <p>Fake news causes citizens to lose trust in social media. The rapid development of the self-media community has not only increased the influence of fake news but also accelerated the spread of fake news. Although I don't know their true purpose, this wrong information seriously affected the authority and credibility of the news media; led to the appearance of wrong public opinion; violated the rights of citizens; wasted time and money, and caused a huge impact on society, It can also cause serious misunderstandings and contradictions between countries.
            </p>
            
           <p>I did some researches and checked a lot of information. I founded that fake news that has affected relations between countries in the past. For example, in 2007, the news of "the murderer of the US campus shooting was initially identified as a Chinese student", during the investigation of the incident, it was initially identified as a Chinese. Later the truth was ascertained that the killer was a Korean. This news was undoubted damages the international image of the Chinese people and will also have a negative impact on the relationship between China and the United States. In addition, fake news causes distress to parties involved in news events. The example can be the fake news that happened in the last presidential election. A picture of Hillary Clinton's fall was claimed by the fake news that she was unhealthy, which caused a lot of negative news, and also let other competitors take the opportunity to cause more public opinion. Needless to say, the impact of fake news on society and the country is beyond our imagination. The media should be social public instruments to defend the public interest, but the frequent appearance of fake news will damage the reputation of the entire news industry and make audiences unable to believe the value of media. Fake news is harmful, and journalists should uphold professional ethics and reject fake news in order to defend the dignity of journalism.
