           <p>The cool club is a website that sells various card game cards. These game cards are not ordinary playing cards. They have different colors and different cute patterns or characters on them, such as cars, animated characters, animals. This is a very interactive website, and every page can have cute and fun interactions with users. I like this website very much, and it will be very interesting to see these cute patterns.</p>
                
            <p>This website is very personalized and modern. The theme color of the entire website is candy color, full of youth and vitality. The card box on the homepage will spit out different cards after clicking with the mouse like a game. When the user choosing different types of cards, and when the mouse touches each carton, the characteristics of which card will be displayed above, such as what patterns are on it. I think this is very user-friendly, and it is convenient for people to buy I easily learned what the card looks like before.</p>
            
           <p>Although there are many colors used on web pages, the entire website looks organized and not confusing. I think this kind of website interaction design is very successful. The website does not use a lot of text, complicated descriptions, or make uses feel confused. Using rich colors and fun game patterns can make users have a very rich interactive experience and every detail is unique. These kinds of websites are very attractive to young people and they will also have a good user experience.  To be honest, the website that sells products should be made in such an attractive style, which not only makes users feel the fun of using the website but also can prompt users to buy products. This will make users feel that this website is very carefully promoting their products.

                <p>Minimalism is also very popular in web design. They represent a generation of young people's pursuit of style. Appntd is a website that sells stationery and furniture products. The main colors of the website are light colors, such as white, apricot, Or light brown. The entire typography is very simple and clear. The website uses a simple font with an all-white background color, which is a very modern and minimalist design.</p>

                  <p>I personally like very successful pages made with simple color combinations and simple layouts. light colors can make the entire page very clean and unique. Since the products sold by their company are also made with simple home colors, so these products match the color of the entire website very well. The entire webpage exudes a calm atmosphere and has the ability to stimulate creativity. The layout of the website considers the space design so that each product and photo are perfectly matched.</p>
                    
                <p>I think that websites that use minimalist themes are designed to allow some users to enjoy the entire calm atmosphere. It is very suitable for those users who do not like rich color mixing. Because if you add too many colors, it will make people's vision confused and make people feel discomfort. They also explain the product information, discounts, and inventory to users on each type of product page. This is a very thoughtful design that allows users to better understand the information about purchased products. They are their own brand I also made a logo. If the user wants to go back to the homepage, he can directly click the logo at the top of the webpage. This is a very convenient and personalized design.</p>
